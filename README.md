This is the repository for [Measurement Theory](), taught by [Christopher J. Fariss](http://cfariss.com).

To submit homeworks for this class do the following. First, read [this tutorial](http://zmjones.com/git-github-tutorial/). Fork this repository and clone it to your local computer. Then, in the homework folder, do your homework. Name the file with your initials, followed by the name of the homework; e.g., `zmj_hw_01.R`. Push this file to your forked copy (`git push origin master`). Then issue a pull request to merge your homework into this repository.

To get changes to this repository set an upstream remote (in the above linked tutorial). When changes are made fetch them from `upstream/master` and merge them with your `master` branch. Then push the changes to your forked GitHub repository and issue a pull request.

This is only the proposed method and is subject to change.g
